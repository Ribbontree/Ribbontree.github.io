My goal is to know more about the way couples interact and how this might be linked to hormonal changes in women’s menstrual cycle.

The effect of women’s changing hormones throughout their cycle on motivational processes such as sexual desire, social contact and food intake are not yet agreed upon. So first of all, I am interested in exploring motivational changes in naturally cycling women compared to those using oral contraceptives. Also, I want to see if their romantic partners are able to notice changes in female motivation and how those influence their romantic partner’s feelings or behaviours.
